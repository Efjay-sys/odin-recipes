                <h2>Why choose Lasagne?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Ancient Roots:</h3>
                        The term <em>"lasagna"</em> itself may have roots in ancient Greek, with "laganon" being a flatbread or pasta dish. 
                        Romans adopted a similar dish called "lagane," which likely inspired the word "lasagne". 
                        <h3>Medieval Italy:</h3>
                        The lasagna we know today, with its layered structure, developed in Naples during the Middle Ages. 
                        The earliest recorded recipe for lasagna is from the 14th century. 
                        <h3>Variations and Evolution:</h3>
                        Lasagna became popular across Italy, with variations emerging in different regions. 
                        For example, the <em>"Lasagne di Carnevale"</em> from Naples features sausage, meatballs, and hard-boiled eggs. 
                        "Lasagne al Forno," from Emilia-Romagna, uses a rich ragù sauce and béchamel. 
                        <h3>Global Popularity:</h3>
                        Italian immigrants brought their lasagna recipes to America, leading to further variations and adaptations. 
                        Today, lasagna is a beloved dish worldwide, enjoyed in countless flavors and forms.
